# Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using a Naive Bayes classifier. It's built using Python and popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify text as either positive or negative sentiment. This is achieved by training a Naive Bayes classifier on a labeled dataset of movie reviews.

## Dataset

The project uses the "IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews" dataset, which can be found here. This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.

## Libraries Used

*   pandas
*   scikit-learn
*   NLTK
*   BeautifulSoup4
*   gradio
*   pickle

## Usage

1.  Download the IMDB dataset and place it in the `data` folder.
2.  Run the `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.
3.  Use the `predict_sentiment` function to predict the sentiment of new text.

## Model Performance

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test set.
