# ML/AI Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Projects Repository**! üöÄ This repository organizes all my ML/AI projects developed using Google Colab, with each project stored on a separate branch for easy navigation.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each project resides in its own branch to keep the repository organized. Below is the structure:

- **`main` branch**: General information about this repository.
- **Project-specific branches**: Each project is stored in a dedicated branch. The branch name corresponds to the project's title for quick identification.
